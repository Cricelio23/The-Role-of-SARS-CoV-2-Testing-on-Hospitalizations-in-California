# The-Role-of-Testing-in-Reducing-Hospitalization

 Epidemiological data.  Publicly available information of COVID-19 regarding daily reported cases and hospitalization  admissions at county-level was obtained from the official website of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) [1]. The hospitalized data are not a cumulative number. Data includes all inpatients (including those in ICUs and Medical/Surgical units) and does not include patients in affiliated clinics, outpatient departments, emergency departments, and overflow locations awaiting an inpatient bed. As of April 21, 2020, COVID emergency department patients were removed from the Hospitalized COVID count and counted separately.
 
In the file Covariables are:
- Demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, and race by county reported by the United State Census Bureau [2].
- The California Healthy Place Index [3]. This value combines twenty-five community characteristics  (the number of people living below the poverty line, the number of people with lower levels of education, areas with more renters and fewer homeowners, among others.) into a single value (HPI) to account for the level of poverty, education, and life expectancy in a particular community.
